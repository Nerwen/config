My configs
----------  

#### Overview
Most configs reside in ~/etc (this repository) and are symlinked to their expected locations from there. 

X starts from System/xinitrc, which starts WM with its specific config in WM/. 

#### Some help to navigate my configs:
* **Apps**  
Configs for various single programs

* **System**   
There are terminal/shell configs, fonts, colors and such

* **WM**  
Window manager, and other pieces for my personal DE. WM configs, compositor, hotkeys and panel

* **Scripts**   
Some small scripts I use often.
