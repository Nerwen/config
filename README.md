My configs
----------  

####Overview
Most configs reside in ~/etc (this repository) and are symlinked to their places from there. 

X starts from System/xinitrc, which starts WM with its specific config in WM/. 

####Some help to navigate my configs:
* **Apps**  
Configs for various single programs

* **System**   
There are terminal configs, fonts, colors and such

* **WM**  
Window manager, and other pieces for my personal DE. WM configs, compositor, hotkeys and panel

* **Scripts** 
Few scripts I like to use, collected from various places. Not very up-to-date.

Paths.md has some of the paths to be symlinked - I'm far too lazy to provide script or something like it. 

####Current setup
* DWM, as the WM
* Termite as terminal emulator
* mksh as the shell
* qutebrowser as the browser
* sxhkd for non-WM keybindings
