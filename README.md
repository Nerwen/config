My configs
----------  

Some help to navigate my configs:
* 	Apps
		Quite obviously, there are configs for various single programs

*		System
		There are terminal configs, fonts, colors and such

*		WM
		Window manager, and other pieces for my personal DE. WM configs, compositor, hotkeys and panel

*		Scripts
		Few scripts I like to use, collected from various places.


Paths.md has some of the paths to be symlinked - I'm far too lazy to provide script or something like it. 

For Firefox, I once used these Stylish-sheets:
http://userstyles.org/styles/90951/reddit-revamped
http://twily.info/firefox/firefox-css

Some of the software I use:
 * Arch Linux
 * bspwm		-		the wm
 * sxhkd		-		hotkey daemon
 * tmux			- 	terminal multiplexer
 * compton 	- 	compositor
 * bar 			- 	bar
 * mpd 			- 	music daemon
 * ncmpcpp 	- 	music client
 * weechat 	-		irc
 * dunst 		- 	notification-daemon
 * hsetroot - 	wallpaper
